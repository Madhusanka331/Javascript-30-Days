![Day 01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65dbdd1d-3525-4c29-bb7a-0b6a1657bfb2)

This project is a simple weather application that allows users to check the weather for any city. Users can enter a city name in the input field, then click the search button or press "Enter" to display the city's current temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app displays a weather icon based on the current conditions (e.g., rain or clear). If an invalid city name is entered, an error message appears.

*Key Features:*

- Fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Displays temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the specified city.
- Includes icons for different weather types and an error message for invalid city inputs.

*Technologies Used:*
- HTML, CSS for structure and styling.
- JavaScript for making API calls and updating the UI based on user input.
